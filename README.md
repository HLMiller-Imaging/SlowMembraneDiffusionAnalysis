# SlowMembraneDiffusionAnalysis
Codes to analyse diffusive motion in 2D geometries, where diffusion can happen at different timescales (e.g. order of Magnitue apart).
Use MSD_calculator2 to truncate the tracks and find all the MSD values at different time lags.
SquareDispFitter5 can be used to determine how many diffusive populations to fit; minimise the reduced chi^2.
BootStrap does the final fit and also bootstraps the answer, to give error bounds.
